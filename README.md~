# restaurant-per-odin-project
Javascript / jQuery website assigned by the Odin Project bootcamp

Odin Project assignment:
Create a home page for a restaurant. Include an image, headline, and some copy about how wonderful the restaurant is. Now remove those elements from the HTML (so leave only the <html>, <body>, and <div id="content"> tags) and instead create them by using Javascript only, e.g. by appending each new element to the div#content once the page is first loaded. Next, set up your restaurant site to use tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages. The key here is that each tab should NOT link to a different HTML page... it should instead trigger a Javascript function to wipe out the current page then create the desired page. Keep it simple! When you click the next tab, your Javascript should automatically remove the "Menu" elements and add in the "Home" elements.
